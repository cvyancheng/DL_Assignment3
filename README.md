NCKU 1112_深度學習 DEEP LEARNING

# 1.Implement LeNet5 (any version) by Tensorflow (Keras is ok) and Pytorch.
## 1.1Tensorflow
https://www.tensorflow.org/overview?hl=zh-cn
### 1.1.1Split dataset
Only do once.
### 1.1.2Load dataset
### 1.1.3Dynamic

## 1.2Pytorch

# 2.Performance Comparison (accuracy, inference time, space complexity, and flops) of the TF/Pytorch and your handcrafted versions. 
## 2.1My handcrafted versions
## 2.2Performance Comparision

# 3.In the TensorFlow version, please make a "static graph" LeNet5 and compare it with a "dynamic" one in inference and training time.
