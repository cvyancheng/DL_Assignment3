# Performance Comparison (accuracy, inference time, space complexity, and flops) of the TF/Pytorch and your handcrafted versions. 
## My handcrafted versions
## Performance Comparision

# In the TensorFlow version, please make a "static graph" LeNet5 and compare it with a "dynamic" one in inference and training time.
