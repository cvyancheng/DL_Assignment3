NCKU 1112_深度學習 DEEP LEARNING

# 1. Implement LeNet5 (any version) by Tensorflow (Keras is ok) and Pytorch.
## 1.1 Tensorflow
https://www.tensorflow.org/overview?hl=zh-cn
### 1.1.1 Split dataset
Only do once.
### 1.1.2 Load dataset
### 1.1.3 Dynamic

## 1.2 Pytorch
https://github.com/gradient-ai/LeNet5-Tutorial?ref=blog.paperspace.com

# 2. Performance Comparison (accuracy, inference time, space complexity, and flops) of the TF/Pytorch and your handcrafted versions. 
## 2.1 My handcrafted versions
## 2.2 Performance Comparision

# 3. In the TensorFlow version, please make a "static graph" LeNet5 and compare it with a "dynamic" one in inference and training time.
## 3.1 Static graph
